# Project: Etch-a-Sketch

## The Odin Project - Foundations

In this project, I'll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex my DOM manipulation skills. I'm going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

This project will _not_ be easy. I’ll probably have to Google frequently to find the right JavaScript methods and CSS to use – in fact, that’s the point!

I _can_ build this using the tools that I've have already learned.


### End of Project Reflections:

1. I have a flair of UI/UX, but probably ended up spending waaaaay too much time on the look of the toy. Specifically my desire to make it look "3D".
2. I'd like to have got the "disclaimer" vertically centered. But gave up.
3. I'd like to have got the "Not Kevin" "sticker" pinned in place to the "Everyone" word. I know, a couple of containers would have done it, but cbf now.
4. Would have like to build in click controls on the knobs. They are animated though, so that was cool.
5. I did the "Screen Size" buttons pretty early on, but don't fancy them now I've finished. I don't feel they match the original styling of the toy. Would prefer to have made the screen size look like a "sticker" that clicked either end of would animate with a "peel away" effect to reveal a different "sticker".
6. Animating the controls knobs was fun.
7. Applying the "random borked pixel" effect was easy but kinda funny. And akin to find an old etch-a-sketch in the garage.
8. I wonder if people will get that the "Classic" "sticker" is actually a pixel color control button lol.
