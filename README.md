# Project: Etch-a-Sketch

## The Odin Project - Foundations

In this project, I'll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex my DOM manipulation skills. I'm going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

This project will _not_ be easy. I’ll probably have to Google frequently to find the right JavaScript methods and CSS to use – in fact, that’s the point!

I _can_ build this using the tools that I've have already learned.
